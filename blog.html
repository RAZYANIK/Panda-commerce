                        include:
                        Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate function body.
                        Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be
                        accessed in their enclosing scope even before they are declared.
                        Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have
                        scope to the immediate enclosing <br>
                        1. Var has the function or global scope. let have the block scope. const variable has the block
                        scope.<br>
                        2. Var can be updated or re-declared. let can only be updated and can't be re-declared. const
                        can't
                        be updated or re-declared. </p>

                        Array functions are something that can help you with any type of manipulation or looping through
                        an array of items in JavaScript. Some of the pre-built functions can have very similar use cases
                        to one another, therefore I have created a list of manipulation functions, with how they look
                        and their use cases. <br><br>
                        <strong>.forEach:</strong>

                        .forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change
                        the array and it returns undefined. <br>
                        <strong>.map():</strong>

                        .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the
                        updated elements. <br>
                        <strong>.filter():</strong>

                        .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a
                        new array with the elements that return 'truthy' for the criteria.<br>
                        <strong>.find():</strong>
                        The find() method returns the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided
                        testing function. If no values satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.

                    <p class="card-text">Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature introduced in
                        ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. While both regular
                        JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner, there are certain differences
                        between them. <br>
                        JavaScript's arrow functions might seem the same as regular functions on the surface, but they
                        have some very important differences:<br>

                        1. Syntactical differences<br>
                        2. this value (execution context)<br>
                        3. Usage as methods<br>
                        4. Usage as constructors<br>
                        5. arguments binding
                        <br>
                        'this' value inside a regular function is dynamic and depends on how the function is invoked.
                        But
                        'this' inside the arrow function is bound lexically and equals to this of the outer function.
                        Fat
                        arrow methods always bind 'this' a value to the class instance.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Template literals provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into strings.

                        The method is called string interpolation.
                        Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line
                        strings, for string interpolation with embedded expressions, and for special constructs called
                        tagged templates.

                        Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are used most
                        commonly for string interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders).
                        However, a tagged template literal may not result in a string; it can be used with a custom tag
                        function to perform whatever operations you want on the different parts of the template literal.
